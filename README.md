# Bi

Bi is a personal experiment. Is a website that displays images from your Instagramâ„¢, but bigger!

The idea behind it is to test technologies like Vue.js, webpack, Docker, PostCSS and yarn among others.

## Run

```bash
docker-compose up -d
open http://localhost:8080/
```

## Build

```bash
docker-compose exec app yarn run build
open ./public
```
